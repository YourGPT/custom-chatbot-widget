### 1. **Overview**

This package uses API integration and webhooks to provide a customizable chatbot solution for any use case. Visitor functionality will not work with this setup. Because this widget uses API integration, it offers direct access to session-level functionality, such as session creation and sending messages. We have also set up a webhook for receiving any messages from the studio, ensuring real-time two-way communication.

### 2. **Installation Instructions**

Instead of installing the package, you will need to clone the project from GitHub to set it up locally. Follow these steps to get started:

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YourGPT/custom-chatbot-widget.git
  ```
- Navigate into the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd custom-chatbot-widget
  ```
- Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### 3. **Environment Setup**

Before starting, create an environment file for your project. Copy the `.env.example` file provided in the repository and create a new `.env` file. Update the keys in this file with your Pusher and API keys.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure that the `.env` file contains the following:

- `VITE_PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id_here`
- `VITE_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key_here`
- `VITE_PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret_here`
- `VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster_here`

### 4. **Pusher Setup**

To use the widget effectively, you need to set up Pusher for real-time communication. Follow these steps:

1. **Pusher Account Setup**: Sign up for a [Pusher account](https://pusher.com/).
2. **Create an App**: Create a new app in the Pusher dashboard.
3. **Frontend Key**: Add the Pusher key for frontend use in your `.env` file as follows:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key_here
   ```
4. **Backend Key**: Add the Pusher key for backend use in your server environment configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   VITE_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key_here
   VITE_PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret_here
   VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster_here
   ```
5. **Webhook Integration**: Set up the webhook to push data using Pusher to the frontend. Add the following webhook URL in your YourGPT webhook integrations:
   ```
   deployed_server_domain/api/chatbot-webhook
   ```
   This will ensure that data from the webhook is properly pushed to the frontend using Pusher.

### 5. **Deploying to Vercel**

You can easily deploy this project to Vercel for hosting. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Vercel Account**: If you haven't already, create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. **Deploy**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect the project settings.
3. **Environment Variables**: During deployment, make sure to add all the environment variables from your `.env` file in the Vercel dashboard.
4. **Build and Deploy**: Vercel will handle the build process. Once deployed, your chatbot widget will be accessible online.

### 6. **Accessing the Widget**

#### **Embedding the Widget on Your Website**

To embed the chatbot widget on your website, use the following script. Replace `deployed_server_domain` with your custom domain from the Vercel deployment and set your specific widget ID.

```html
<script>
  window.YGC_WIDGET_ID = "8449240d-8454-4173-af6e";
  (function () {
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "https://deployed_server_domain/script.js";
    script.id = "yourgpt-custom-widget-script";
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  })();
</script>
```

Add this code snippet to your website, and it will load the chatbot widget with your custom configuration.

#### **Direct Link Access**

If you do not want to embed the widget on your website and prefer accessing it via a direct link, you can use the following URL pattern:

```
https://deployed_server_domain/8449240d-8454-4173-af6e
```

Replace `8449240d-8454-4173-af6e`Ã‚ with your specific widget ID. This link provides direct access to the deployed chatbot.
